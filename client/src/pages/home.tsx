        The concept of a flat Earth has been prevalent throughout human
        civilization since ancient times. From the Mesopotamians to the
        Egyptians, countless cultures have shared this belief due to their
        observation of the horizon and the appearance of celestial bodies. As
        time progressed, scientists like Aristotle and Galileo proposed the idea
        of a spherical Earth, but many still clung onto the flat Earth model
        despite mounting evidence against it.
        <br />
        <br />
